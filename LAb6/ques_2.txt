1.Create  a keyspace by name Library
>	CREATE KEYSPACE Library with replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};

2. Create a column family by name Library-Info with attributes 
     Stud_Id Primary Key,
     Counter_value of type Counter,
    Stud_Name, Book-Name, Book-Id, Date_of_issue.
>	CREATE COLUMNFAMILY Library_Info(
        Stud_id int,
        Counter_val counter,
        Stud_name text,
        Book_name text,
        Book_id int,
        Date_of_issue date,
        primary key (Stud_id, Stud_name, Book_name, Book_id, Date_of_issue)
    );

3. Insert the values into the table in batch
>	Update Library_Info set Counter_val = Counter_val + 1 where Stud_id=121 and Stud_name = 'Kedar' and Book_id=130 and Book_name='DSR' and date_of_issue='2020-09-19';
> 	Update Library_Info set Counter_val = Counter_val + 1 where Stud_id=142 and Stud_name = 'Kratharth' and Book_id=134 and Book_name='Data Communications' and date_of_issue='2020-08-27';
> 	Update Library_Info set Counter_val = Counter_val + 1 where Stud_id=111 and Stud_name = 'Krishna' and Book_id=100 and Book_name='BDA' and date_of_issue='2020-02-19';

4.  Display the details of the table created and increase the value of the counter 
>	Update Library_Info set Counter_val = Counter_val + 1 where Stud_id=121 and Stud_name = 'Kedar' and Book_id=130 and Book_name='DSR' and date_of_issue='2020-09-19';

5. Write a query to show that a student with id 112 has taken a book “BDA” 2 times.
>	select * from Library_Info where Stud_id=121 and Counter_val=3 ALLOW FILTERING;

6. Export the created column to a csv file
>	Copy Library_info(Stud_id, Stud_name, Book_name, Book_id, Date_of_issue, Counter_val) TO 'D:\BMSCE\sem7\BDA\BDA-1BM17CS042\LAb6\exported.csv';

7. Import a given csv dataset from local file system into Cassandra column family
>	COPY GOOGLE_APPS from 'D:\BMSCE\sem7\BDA\BDA-1BM17CS042\LAb6\googleplaystore.csv' WITH DELIMITER=',' AND HEADER=TRUE;
